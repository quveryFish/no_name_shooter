Hello

VERY VERY IMPORTANT Recommandations
-For this asset specifically I recommend to NOT use a metallic roughness workflow;(it would wash the color?)
Just use A diffuse or even an unlit/emission shader, it would work best/or a spec gloss workflow would work nice also but you can do whatever you want 
If you don't know how to do this, you can also just use the Emission version of the objects
Or if you persist to use metroughness workflow : try to see what roughness and metallic works best for you(I recommend to put the roughness value to 1 and metallic to 0)


FOR FBX USERS : 
Metallic, Roughness, Alpha may NOT WORK properly, 
you may be need to re plug them or ADJUST the value.


FOR UNITY USERS : 
If material have alpha : you'll need to enable alpha cliping in the material inspector's tab if there's alpha texture 
or if old rendering pipeline : change opaque to something :)
and you guys are also FBX USERS so you'll need to replug the materials if needed

FOR GLTF GLB USERS: 
nothing to do, should work fine :) 


UNREAL ENGINE :
If you are using UNREAL ENGINE please USE GLB,GLTF so you don't have to setup all the materials, 
but if you persist to use fbx files, then when importing, CHECK FLIPPED -Y FOR NORMAL MAP option.
If you want to import the model without having all the parts separated, just check the option when importing



If you think my work is usefull, you can donate me a little thing in itch,
that would help me to make more FREE assets
